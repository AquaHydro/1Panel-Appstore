- **22330**: Data transfer port (set by variable)
- **3000**: Public relay port (optional, not mapped by default)
- **22027/22037**: LAN UDP discovery ports (optional, not mapped by default)

## Quick Deployment (Docker Example)

```yaml
services:
  verysync:
    image: jonnyan404/verysync:v2.20.1
    container_name: verysync
    ports:
      - "${PANEL_APP_PORT_HTTP}:8886"   # Web management port
      - "${VERYSYNC_TRANSFER_PORT}:22330"   # Data transfer port
      # - "3000:3000"         # Public relay port (optional)
      # - "22027:22027/udp"   # LAN UDP discovery port (optional)
      # - "22037:22037/udp"   # LAN UDP discovery port (optional)
    volumes:
